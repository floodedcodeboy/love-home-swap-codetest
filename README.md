# LOVE HOME SWAP Code Test

## The Brief

_Company Ltd_ with a large number of branches across Europe handle their sales payroll in the following way:

> The normal base salaries are paid on the last day of the month unless that day is a Saturday or a Sunday (weekend); if this is the case they will be paid on the last working day of the month. 

> On the 1st and 15th of each month the expenses are paid for the previous fortnight, unless those days are on a weekend, in which case they are paid on the first Monday after that date.

The company needs the output in the following format:

```
"Month Name", "1st expenses day", “2nd expenses day”, "Salary day" 
"January", "YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD" 
"February", "YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD" 
```

Your task is to create an application, which implements this code flow and can output the pay dates for any given year. 

This application will output a to a file, which name and year for which is calculated are given from the cli.

Please approach this as you would a normal work project and ensure that all code is completed to a standard that you are happy with; ensuring that includes unit testing, could be reused to support the output in different languages etc.
 
Submit the code or send us the Github link to the repository.
